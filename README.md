This repository provides a **complete local installation setup for Odoo 17** on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

It includes everything you need to run Odoo locally with a production-like environment:
- **Python virtual environment** setup for dependency management
- **PostgreSQL database configuration** for Odoo
- **Systemd service** to start Odoo automatically on boot
- **Nginx reverse proxy** for secure and efficient web access
- **Project structure and configuration files** for easy customization

This setup is ideal for:
- Developers who want to work on Odoo modules locally  
- Testing Odoo features before deploying to production  
- Learning Odoo 17 installation and configuration end-to-end

### 🛠 Detailed Steps

🏗️ Project Structure Initialization
Create the base directory and essential subfolders to keep the installation organized:
config/: For odoo.conf and Nginx configurations.
logs/: For Odoo and Nginx log files.
systemd/: To store the service unit file.

⚙️ Prerequisites & Dependencies
Install the required system packages:
Python 3.12, pip, and virtualenv.
Development libraries for Odoo.
NodeJS & npm (for RTL support).
wkhtmltopdf (for PDF report generation).

🐘 PostgreSQL Database Setup
Install PostgreSQL server.
Create a dedicated database user matching your system user.
Configure Peer Authentication to allow seamless local connections.

📂 Odoo 17 Source Code
Clone the official Odoo 17 branch directly from GitHub into your project folder.

🐍 Python Virtual Environment (venv)
Create a clean isolation layer using python3 -m venv venv.
Install all requirements listed in requirements.txt.
Note: Ensure setuptools is updated to avoid pkg_resources warnings.

📝 Odoo Configuration
Create odoo.conf within the config/ directory. Key parameters:
db_user & db_password.
addons_path: Pointing to your Odoo and custom addons.
logfile: Path to your logs/ folder.

xmlrpc_port: Defaulting to 8069.

🔧 Systemd Service Integration
Create a systemd unit file to manage the Odoo process. This ensures:
Automatic start on system boot.
Automatic restart on failure.
Easy management via systemctl.

🌐 Nginx Reverse Proxy
Configure Nginx to handle incoming traffic on port 80/443:
Forward requests to Odoo (8069).
Handle Longpolling on port 8072 for real-time chat/updates.
Manage access and error logs within the project directory.

🏁 Verification
Once completed, the system should be accessible via:
Direct: http://your_ip:8069
Production: http://your_domain_or_ip (via Nginx)
